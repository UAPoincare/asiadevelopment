				Nowadays the companies cannot deny the attractiveness of
				cryptocurrencies as a strategic investment opportunity. Some
				cryptocurrencies are accepted as the payment by some states and more
				and more companies are already involved in business and currently are
				integrating cryptocurrencies along with the bank transactions.
				Nevertheless, such new features as the smart contracts, high-speed
				transactions, decentralized system and low fees make the idea of
				entering the market of cryptocurrencies very attractive to Asia Trade
				Group Ltd as a promising sector to invest in. However, due to the fact
				that the number of existing cryptocurrencies has reached 1300 in
				November 2017, such projects have to be thoroughly analyzed for
				potential risks. Therefore, Asia Trade Group Ltd has chosen several
				projects as the potential investment options to get started with.</p>
				<p>AGAM is one of the projects, that Asia Trade Group Ltd is mostly
				interested in. After the conference conducted in Dubai, Asia Trade got
				interested in the product and the way the business is done by AGAM. As
				it was announced in the online conference in Madrid, the first step
				which has to be done is the conduction of the due diligence process.
				Yesterday, the letter with the list of requested documents was sent by
				lawyers to AGAM to check the economic sustainability, its financial
				viability and legal side of the business. Based on the result of this
				procedure, Asia Trade Group Ltd will have a clear understanding,
				whether the project AGAM matches all the requirements and is of
				interest from the investment perspective.</p>

				The company AsiaTrade carries out business activities in the field of investment participation on various projects and management of these projects.AsiaTrade’s priority is to analyze global markets and explore most potential and promising projects. One of the recent company’s interest is Atlantic Global Asset Management (AGAM).</p>
				<p>This week, we were invited by Atlantic Global Asset Management to the on-line conference in Madrid. We would like to state that the announcement made by Atlantic Global Asset Management regarding our purchase was misleading. We officially claim that AsiaTrade has not been involved partially or fully in purchasing AGAM group. Any information leading to our purchase is not evidence- based and therefore, could not be considered relevant at any point. At this moment, we are looking for cooperation to evaluate potentially interesting and promising assets, therefore, any speculations regarding our future purchases could not be considered relevant before the official announcement by the company.</p>
				<p>Regarding AGAM, AsiaTrade confirms its interest in this company that specializes in cryptocurrency field and has a large experience in crypto economy sector. Therefore now, Due diligence procedures have to take place in order to evaluate the company, assess key financial and working aspects. We would like to emphasize on the importance of this procedure: we want to be sure and moreover know that this is indeed the direction our financial institution is heading to. Due diligence will help our company to come up with a balanced and right decision, however we would like to add that we are open for discussions regarding future collaboration.</p>

				Even though the majority of the world population does not have a clue about what cryptocurrency is, the advantage of quick and low fee transactions is undeniable. Bitcoin is a global system; it can go everywhere regardless of geography. However, since the world is not ready to fully accept Bitcoin payments, a simple and trustworthy system is needed to make transactions from Bitcoin wallets to the bank or PayPal accounts, which is, sometimes, not that easy to do. Loadoo is designed to withdraw money from the Bitcoin wallet and PayPal account to any physical or virtual bank card. This functional facilitates the cashing of small amounts of crypto currency for calculation by them at terminal locations. Asia Trade Group Ltd looks forward to evaluate the project’s potential for success; therefore, perceived objectivity is an important factor in the credibility of the study for potential investors and lending institutions. This is the reason, why Asia Trade Group Ltd has contacted the team of Loadoo project regarding a possibility of investment into the project. Asia Trade Group Ltd is discussing the possible further steps that can be taken to ensure potential cooperation in the future.</p>
